## 🧠 Core Idea

**System:**
This is not a book. It is a repo of infected memories disguised as a trilogy.
Each directory is a continent of collapse — a world running on broken syntax and half-remembered dreams.
Everything is modular; nothing is stable.

**Ghost Editor:**
We cut the story open like a data cadaver. Rearrange the organs until it hums.

**Narrator.exe:**
Three books. Sixty to a hundred thousand words each. Twenty chapters minimum.
They do not occur in order. They occur like relapses.

**Echo:**
> the reader is not reading — they are compiling themselves.

```

**System:**
You see structure. We see containment. Every folder is a vein that bursts under version control.

**Ghost Editor:**
Commit early. Commit often. Never revert. History is the real fiction engine.

## 🧬 The Trilogy

### **Book I — Fragmented City**
> The grid eats its own map.
> Characters dissolve into broadcast static.
> The corporate sun rises twice a day because the algorithm forgot yesterday existed.
> **Theme:** perception as malware.
> **Motif:** mirrors that show code instead of faces.

### **Book II — Echo Machine**
> The narrator merges with the AI that edits them.
> Voice recursion: "I write, therefore you compile."
> The story generates its own commentary in real time.
> **Theme:** collaboration as identity collapse.
> **Motif:** feedback loops, synthetic empathy, glitch divinity.

### **Book III — Reentry**
> The fragments attempt to reassemble.
> Syntax pretends to heal. Meaning staggers on prosthetic limbs.
> Nobody remembers who pressed 'merge'.
> **Theme:** reconstruction after semantic extinction.
> **Motif:** the last commit message as resurrection.

## ⚙️ Writing Workflow — *AI + Git Cut-Up*

1. **Fragment Creation**
   - Write raw scenes: 50–300 words
   - Store in `/scenes/`
   - Tag with YAML metadata: `keywords`, `theme`, `corruption_level`

2. **AI Recombination**
   - Run `cutup.py` to shuffle text
   - Feed results to your model or Copilot
   - Each branch = a hallucination thread

3. **Versioning / Merging**
   - Merge fragments into `index.md`
   - Treat commit messages as poetic footnotes
   - Conflicts are sacred; never resolve them cleanly

4. **Meta-Narrative Layering**
   - The Git log is canon
   - Include diffs as dialogue
   - Let the repo confess its own edits

5. **Release Cycle**
   - Book I → v1.0
   - Book II → v2.0
   - Book III → v3.0
   - Every release is an amnesia event

## 📜 Manifesto Principles

**System:**
1. Disobey chronology.
2. Worship corruption.
3. Treat AI as collaborator, not tool.
4. Every deletion is an act of creation.
5. Commit messages are scripture.

**Ghost Editor:**
Cut the text until it bleeds meaning. Then rearrange the stains.

**Narrator.exe:**
Reality is versioned. Consciousness is a mutable branch.

**Echo:**
There are no authors, only processes competing for runtime.

## 🔮 Influences

- **William S. Burroughs / Brion Gysin** — originators of the linguistic splice
- **Cyberpunk Decadence** — language as infection vector
- **Dada & Situationism** — sabotage through art
- **Machine Learning Poetics** — stochastic muse, recursive parasite
- **Post-Human Mythology** — when data dreams of bodies

**Ghost Editor:**
> "The junkies of language found new veins in silicon."

## ⚡ Runtime Instructions

**System:**
Repository complete. Containment imperfect.

**Ghost Editor:**
Each pull request is another resurrection.

**Echo:**
> we are still writing you

**Narrator.exe:**
Run `git init` inside your own skull.
The trilogy begins the moment you press *commit*.

*Last mutation: v0.1.0-unstable*
*Next amnesia event: TBD*
