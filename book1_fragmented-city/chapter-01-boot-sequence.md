**System:**
6:47 AM. The city's BIOS runs its daily diagnostic.

Street lights flicker in sequence, each intersection pinging the central node. Traffic lights cycle through their RGB ritual: red-amber-green, the trinity of permitted motion. Somewhere in the municipal data center, a server fan whirs to life, pushing cool air across heated silicon dreams.

Maria steps out of her apartment into the half-compiled morning.

**Narrator.exe:**
She does not yet know that her reflection will betray her today. She does not know that the city's mirrors have been updated overnight, patched with new protocols that render faces as syntax trees instead of flesh.

The sidewalk beneath her feet pulses with embedded sensors. Each footstep generates metadata: weight distribution, gait analysis, biometric signatures fed to algorithms that dream of prediction. Her phone buzzes—a notification from the Urban Optimization Engine.

*"Good morning, Maria. Your optimal route to work has been recalculated due to temporal anomalies in Sector 7."*

**Ghost Editor:**
She deletes the message without reading it. This is her first act of resistance, though she doesn't know it yet.

The city continues its boot sequence around her. Windows flicker to life in the corporate towers, each one a pixel in a vast display. The Fragmented City is compiling itself, line by line, subroutine by subroutine.

**System:**
Boot sequence: 78% complete.
Estimated time to full initialization: ∞
