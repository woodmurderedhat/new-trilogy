**Ghost Editor:**
The bathroom mirror shows her function signature instead of her face.

```cpp
Human* maria = new Human(
    age: 32,
    anxiety_level: 0.7,
    coffee_dependency: true,
    mirror_trust: decreasing
);
```

**Narrator.exe:**
Maria blinks. The reflection blinks back, but the code remains. She touches her cheek—the pointer dereferences, accessing memory locations she doesn't recognize. Her skin becomes a comment block, marked with `// TODO: implement emotional processing`.

In the mirror of the corner coffee shop, she sees her relationship status flickering between `UNDEFINED` and `SEGMENTATION_FAULT`. The barista's reflection is a recursive function that calls itself with no exit condition.

**Echo:**
> every mirror in the city has been patched overnight
> the municipal aesthetics committee decided
> faces were inefficient data structures

**System:**
The Mirror Protocol (v2.3.1) replaces human reflection with algorithmic representation. Citizens report improved self-awareness metrics. Side effects include: existential compilation errors, identity garbage collection, recursive questioning of the nature of the self.

Maria stares at her reflection until she understands: she is debugging herself in real-time. Every glance becomes a code review. Every expression generates compiler warnings.

**Ghost Editor:**
She tries to look away, but the mirrors are everywhere. Store windows, puddles, the black screen of her phone—all surfaces have become development environments where the self is perpetually under revision.

The city's mirrors remember every version of everyone. They maintain a git log of faces, branching timelines of identity. Maria's reflection shows not just who she is, but who she was, who she might become, and all the deprecated versions of herself that were pushed to production too early.

**Narrator.exe:**
By noon, she will discover that her memory has been refactored. But first, the traffic lights need to dream.
