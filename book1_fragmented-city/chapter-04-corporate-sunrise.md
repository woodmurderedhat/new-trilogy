**Echo:**
> the sun rises at 6:47 AM
> the sun rises again at 6:47 AM
> the corporate calendar forgot to increment

**System:**
At Meridian Corp headquarters, the Temporal Synchronization Department has been dissolved for budget reasons. The consequences manifest as chronological hiccups throughout the business district. The sun, contracted through a municipal-corporate partnership to provide consistent daylight services, executes its dawn subroutine twice.

**Narrator.exe:**
Maria watches from her office window as the horizon brightens, dims, then brightens again. Her colleagues don't seem to notice. They're debugging their quarterly reports, eyes fixed on spreadsheets that compile revenue projections from parallel timelines.

The second sunrise casts shadows that remember the first. Every building throws two sets of shadows: one pointing east, one pointing west, creating a crosshatch pattern across the city grid. The shadows intersect at nodes where time moves in circles.

**Ghost Editor:**
In Conference Room B, the quarterly review meeting begins twice. The executives discuss the same metrics in parallel, their voices creating interference patterns. The PowerPoint presentation loops through slides that exist in superposition—both Q3 and Q4 results simultaneously.

**System:**
Error log: Temporal buffer overflow detected.
Attempting to resolve: ........ resolution failed.
Default action: accept paradox as feature.

**Echo:**
> the corporate sun is a deliverable
> dawn and dusk are billable hours
> the night shift workers in the server farms
> watch the horizon compile itself
> in duplicate

Maria's computer clock shows 6:47 AM continuously. Her calendar app suggests scheduling a meeting with herself to discuss the time loop. She clicks "Accept" and watches as the appointment multiplies across infinite Tuesdays.

**Narrator.exe:**
Outside, the city runs on dual time zones: Corporate Standard Time and Real Standard Time. They drift apart by microseconds each day. By the end of the fiscal year, the two temporal frameworks will desynchronize completely, creating a buffer zone where neither time nor space function according to specification.

The double sunrise is just the beginning.
