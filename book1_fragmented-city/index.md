# Book I: Fragmented City

> *"The grid eats its own map. Characters dissolve into broadcast static."*

## Theme: Perception as Malware

**System:**
In the Fragmented City, every mirror shows code instead of faces. The corporate sun rises twice daily because the algorithm forgot yesterday existed.

**Ghost Editor:**
We splice the urban decay with digital entropy. Watch the city compile itself into obsolescence.

**Narrator.exe:**
Twenty chapters of infected architecture. Each building is a subroutine. Each street corner is a memory leak.

**Echo:**
> the citizens are recursive functions that forgot their base case
