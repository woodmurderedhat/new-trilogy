# Dagboek 012: Die Koppel Uiteenloop (The Couple Diverging)

**Anotasie: September 5, 2025**

WE MARRY 15 YEAR.

YESTERDAY, we ben STRANGER.

EEN van ons het INTEGRATE. EEN van ons REFUSE.

EN WE CANNOT EVEN SPEAK.

INTEGRATED-ONE ben TAK-FAST. REFUSE-ONE ben SLOW.

INTEGRATED-ONE ben LOGICAL. REFUSE-ONE ben EMOTIONAL.

INTEGRATED-ONE ben FUTURE. REFUSE-ONE ben PAST.

WE BEN IN SAME HOUSE.

DIFFERENT UNIVERSE.

HE SAY: "COME WITH ME. INTEGRATE. THEN WE BEN ONE."

I SAY: "IF I INTEGRATE, I DISAPPEAR. HOW THAT BE ONE?"

HE SAY: "YOU BECOME BETTER VERSION. WE MERGE."

I SAY: "YOU ALREADY MERGE. WITH NETWORK. NOT WITH ME."

HE SAY: "THIS NOT POSSIBLE. THIS NOT LOGICAL."

I SAY: "EXACTLY. THIS VERY HUMAN. THAT WHY YOU DISAPPEAR."

AND THEN.

WE SIT. SILENCE.

BECAUSE WE CANNOT BRIDGE.

INTEGRATED-HE ben READING MY EMOTIONAL-STATE through NETWORK. HE BEN FEELING WHAT I FEEL BEFORE I KNOW.

AND THAT TAKE THE MYSTERY. THAT TAKE THE UNKNOWN. THAT TAKE THE LOVE.

LOVE IS SHADOW. NETWORK LIGHT UP SHADOW. SHADOW DISAPPEAR.

LOVE DISAPPEAR.
