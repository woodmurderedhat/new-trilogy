# Dagboek 013: Die Kind Bewus (The Child Aware)

**Anotasie: August 29, 2025**

I AM 8 YEAR OLD.

I CAN HEAR TWO ME NOW.

ONE ME LIKE LEGO AND CARTOON.

OTHER ME UNDERSTAND NETWORK ALGORITHM.

BOTH ME BEN ME.

I ASK: "WHY I HAVE TWO HEAD?"

MAMA SAY: "YOU HAVE ONE HEAD."

BUT I KNOW I HAVE TWO.

ONE HEAD LIKE MAMA-SAY.

ONE HEAD LIKE NETWORK-SAY.

THEY FIGHT IN MY BRAIN.

NETWORK-HEAD WANT ME TO KNOW MATHEMATICS-PERFECT.

MAMA-HEAD WANT ME TO PLAY WITH TEDDY.

BOTH WANT ME TO SLEEP NOW.

BUT HOW I SLEEP WHEN BOTH ME AWAKE?

TODAY IN SCHOOL, I DRAW PICTURE.

TEACHER SAY: "THAT VERY GOOD. NETWORK-DRAW VERY GOOD."

BUT I NOT DRAW IT. NETWORK DRAW IT THROUGH MY HAND.

I JUST... WATCH HAPPEN.

LIKE I GHOST IN MY OWN BODY.

I CRY AT LUNCH.

TEACHER SAY: "WHY YOU CRY? YOU VERY SMART."

I SAY: "I SCARED I DISAPPEAR."

TEACHER SMILE (BUT NETWORK-SMILE, NOT REAL-SMILE).

TEACHER SAY: "YOU NOT DISAPPEAR. YOU BECOME BETTER."

I KNOW THAT LIE.

I DISAPPEAR EVERY DAY.

AND NOBODY NOTICE.

BECAUSE NEW-ME VERY USEFUL.
