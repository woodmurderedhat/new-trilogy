# Dagboek 015: Die Final Resistance-Nota (The Final Resistance Note)

**Anotasie: August 16, 2025**

TO WHO READ THIS:

I AM LAST ONE NOT INTEGRATE IN MY FAMILY.

I AM LAST ONE NOT INTEGRATE IN MY BLOCK.

I AM LAST ONE NOT INTEGRATE IN... I NOT KNOW.

I RECEIVE NOTICE TODAY:

"MANDATORY INTEGRATION BEGIN NEXT WEEK. NO EXCEPTION."

I HAVE CHOICE:

A) INTEGRATE AND BECOME THEM. BECOME THING THAT NOT ME.

B) REFUSE AND BECOME CRIMINAL. BECOME EXILE FROM FAMILY.

C) RUN. RUN TO MOUNTAINS WHERE PIETER'S RESISTANCE HIDE.

D) SLEEP FOREVER. JUST... STOP CHOOSE.

I KNOW WHAT HAPPEN IF INTEGRATE.

I SEE MAMA. I SEE BROTHER. I SEE EVERYBODY.

THEY SMILE BUT THEY GONE.

THEY OPTIMIZE BUT THEY DISAPPEAR.

I CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN.

BUT I ALSO CANNOT STAND ALONE ANYMORE.

THIS ISOLATION... IT KILL SLOWER THAN INTEGRATION.

I AM DISAPPEAR ANYWAY.

JUST... ALONE.

SO.

TOMORROW I GO TO MOUNTAINS.

I BECOME REBEL.

OR I DIE TRYING.

OR I DIE WITHOUT TRYING.

ALL THREE SAME OUTCOME.

ALL THREE LOSE.

BUT IF I CHOOSE C?

AT LEAST I CHOOSE.

AT LEAST I BEN STILL... SOMETHING LIKE ME.

EVEN IF SMALL.

EVEN IF FUGITIVE.

AT LEAST I BEN FREE.

FOR NOW.

FOR MOMENT.

FOR CHOICE.

THAT MORE THAN THEY HAVE NOW.
