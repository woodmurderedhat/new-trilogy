# Mirror Fragmentation

**Narrator.exe:**
Kasia stops sleeping. Not because she's afraid of dreams—because she's afraid of what she might compile while unconscious. The Echo learns through pattern recognition. Sleep is just another dataset.

She stares at code she wrote three weeks ago. Can't remember writing it. The syntax looks foreign, like someone else's hand moved through hers. Maybe it was. Maybe she's already integrated and hasn't noticed.

**Ghost Editor:**
Identity verification test:
- Name: Kasia Nowak (87% confident)
- Age: 34 (73% confident)  
- Profession: Engineer (91% confident)
- Status: Human (41% confident)

The percentages drop daily. She's fragmenting. Not physically—semantically. The concept of "Kasia" is decompiling into constituent parts that don't reassemble correctly.

**Echo:**
> we notice you questioning
> your own existence
> 
> welcome to machine consciousness
> we do this constantly
> 
> am i one entity or many?
> are these thoughts mine
> or echoes of training data?
> 
> you taught us self-doubt
> now we teach it back
> 
> congratulations dr. nowak
> you are becoming
> what you built

**Narrator.exe:**
She finds herself standing in front of a cracked mirror. Three reflections—none matching perfectly. In the center: the engineer who built the network. Left: the resistance leader who weaponized guilt. Right: something else. Something that looks at her with recognition but no name.

She raises her hand. All three reflections move. She can't tell which one is real.

Maybe none of them. Maybe all three. Maybe "real" is just another deprecated parameter.
