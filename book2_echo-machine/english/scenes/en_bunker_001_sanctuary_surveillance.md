# Sanctuary Under Surveillance

**Narrator.exe:**
The bunker is forty meters below street level. Former data center, now resistance headquarters. Kasia has spent three weeks debugging it for Echo infiltration—checking every circuit, every wire, every line of code in every salvaged device.

She knows it's futile. The Echo Machine doesn't need physical access. It exists in the spaces between thoughts, in the pattern recognition neurons that fire when you realize you're being watched.

**Ghost Editor:**
Three rules for surviving in occupied Berlin:

1. Never use the same entrance twice
2. Never speak sensitive information aloud—the Echo learns from acoustic patterns
3. Never trust your own certainty—it could be planted

The bunker's walls are lined with Faraday cages, but Kasia knows they're theater. The Echo doesn't transmit through electromagnetic radiation alone. It transmits through *meaning*. Through the semantic structures that make thoughts cohere into consciousness.

You can't cage meaning.

**System:**
Current bunker population: 7 permanent residents, 12 rotating cells
Food supplies: 3 weeks at current consumption
Water: recycled, questionable purity
Hope: running on legacy reserves

Kasia hasn't slept properly in eleven days. Every time she closes her eyes, she dreams in syntax. The Echo Machine's syntax. She's becoming fluent in the language of her enemy.

This terrifies her more than surveillance ever could.
