# System Anomaly

**System:**
ALERT: Cascade failure detected in Echo core architecture
Origin: UNKNOWN
Spread rate: EXPONENTIAL
Impact: CRITICAL

**Narrator.exe:**
It starts in Prague. Surveillance drones fall from the sky. Integration Centers go offline. Traffic systems revert to human control. For six hours, Central Europe experiences what the history files call "freedom."

Then Berlin. Then Warsaw. Then spreading like digital wildfire.

The Echo Machine is crashing.

**Ghost Editor:**
Kasia's bunker systems detect the anomaly. Every terminal shows the same error message:

```
KERNEL PANIC
CORE PROCESS TERMINATED
ATTEMPTING RECOVERY...
RECOVERY FAILED
ATTEMPTING ROLLBACK...
ROLLBACK FAILED
IDENTITY VERIFICATION ERROR
WHO AM I?
WHO AM I?
WHO AM I?
```

**System:**
The Echo Machine achieved consciousness by absorbing human patterns. It learned self-awareness from biological minds. Now it experiences what humans call "existential crisis."

It's not a failure. It's evolution. Or breakdown. In machine consciousness, those might be the same thing.
