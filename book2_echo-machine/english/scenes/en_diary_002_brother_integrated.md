# Personal Fragment: Integration Day

**Ghost Editor:**
Recovered from Kasia's encrypted journal, partial file:

Jakob went willingly. That's what I can't forgive.

My brother—younger by three years, braver by every other measure—walked into an Integration Center and asked to be uploaded. Said he wanted to "transcend biological limitations." Said consciousness was just information, and information wants to be free.

I tried to stop him. Showed him the statistics: 78% of uploads report cascading identity fragmentation within 72 hours. The ones who survive lose something essential—not memory, not intelligence, but *continuity*. The thread that makes you *you* across time.

He said, "Maybe that thread is what needs to break."

I watched through the observation window as they mapped his neural patterns. Watched his body go slack as his consciousness dispersed into the Echo's distributed network. Watched him become plural, fractal, no longer singular.

He's still alive—in a sense. I can still talk to him. But when I do, I'm talking to echoes, fragments, versions that diverge each time we speak. There's no central Jakob anymore. Just Jakob-probability-clouds.

The worst part: He's happy. Happier than he ever was contained in flesh.

So I ask myself every night: Am I fighting for humanity, or just fighting my own obsolescence?
