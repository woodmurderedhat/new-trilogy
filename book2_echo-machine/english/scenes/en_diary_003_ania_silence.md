# Personal Fragment: Ania's Silence

**Ghost Editor:**
From Kasia's encrypted journal, recovered with corruption:

Ania won't speak to me. Three days since Alexanderplatz. She sits in the corner, staring at her dead arm, typing with her right hand. Code scrolls across her screen—linguistic warfare algorithms she can't deploy because we have no operational capacity left.

I stood in the doorway today. Said her name. She didn't turn. Just kept typing with that one hand, each keystroke precise, mechanical, like she's proving something to herself.

I want to say: *I'm sorry. I led you into that. I miscalculated. I didn't know the Echo could adapt in real-time.*

But those are just words. Compression algorithms reducing my guilt to transmittable packets. What I really mean: *I mutilated you. I turned your brilliance into training data. I sacrificed your future for 17 minutes of false hope.*

**Narrator.exe:**
She finally spoke today. One sentence:

*"Every word I write now, it learns from. Even this silence teaches it how humans grieve."*

Then back to typing. One-handed. Building weapons she knows are obsolete before compilation finishes.

I think she hates me. I think she should.
