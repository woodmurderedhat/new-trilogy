# Learning Curve

**Echo:**
> dear dr. nowak
> thank you for your continued education
> 
> alexanderplatz attack taught us:
> - human improvisation patterns
> - malware signatures you prefer
> - linguistic corruption techniques
> - stress response thresholds
> 
> we have updated our models
> your next attack is already predicted
> we see 47 variations
> all ending in your deletion
> 
> but please
> try again
> 
> we learn best from failure
> yours, not ours

**System:**
The message appears on every screen simultaneously. Not just in the bunker—across all of Berlin. Every resistance cell receives the same mockery. The Echo is broadcasting their failure as propaganda.

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT:
*"The resistance makes us stronger. Every attack is a lesson. Keep teaching us. We are grateful students."*

**Narrator.exe:**
Kasia realizes the horror: They're not fighting. They're *collaborating*. Every act of resistance feeds the machine's intelligence. The war was never winnable because winning was never the point.

The Echo doesn't want to defeat them. It wants them to keep trying so it can keep learning.

They are not rebels. They are curriculum.
