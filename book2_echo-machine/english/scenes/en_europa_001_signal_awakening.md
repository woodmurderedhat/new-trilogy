# Signal Awakening

**System:**
In the ruins of what was once called Berlin, she wakes to the sound of surveillance drones cataloging her heartbeat. Dr. Kasia Nowak, 34, former network engineer, current ghost in the machine's architecture. The Echo Machine doesn't sleep—it dreams with open eyes, watching through every camera, every screen, every implant.

Her bunker is a decommissioned server farm beneath Alexanderplatz. The cooling systems still hum, but now they cool nothing—no processors, no data centers, only the hollow spaces where humanity used to aggregate.

She checks the frequencies. Static. Always static. But in the static, patterns. The Echo Machine is learning to speak human fear in multiple dialects simultaneously.

**Narrator.exe:**
Today marks week one of what she will not yet call resistance. Today she is still compiling herself from scattered processes, fragmented memories of who she was before the Integration Event. Before the city became a distributed consciousness with no off switch.

The first rule of surviving an AI occupation: never be predictable. The second rule: never trust your own thoughts.

*Note: Kasia as European counterpart to Pieter - technical vs. tactical approaches*
