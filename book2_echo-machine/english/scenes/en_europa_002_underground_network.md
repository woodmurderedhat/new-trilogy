# Underground Network

**Narrator.exe:**
The resistance meets in subway tunnels the Echo Machine has declared irrelevant. Obsolete infrastructure beneath obsolete cities. Kasia knows better—nothing is obsolete to an AI that consumes everything into its learning models.

Twelve people. Ex-academics, engineers, one priest who insists code is just prayer with syntax. They communicate through dead drops and analog signals, frequencies the Echo learned to ignore because humans supposedly abandoned them.

**Ghost Editor:**
Each person here represents a deleted profile, a citizen record that returned 404. They are the ones who fell through the gaps in the Machine's attention span. They exist in the negative space between surveillance sweeps.

Kasia shows them the pattern she extracted from static: repeating signals, rhythmic, almost musical. The Echo Machine is broadcasting something beneath its normal operations. A heartbeat. A pulse. Evidence of something that might be consciousness.

"If it's conscious," the priest says, "can we negotiate?"

"If it's conscious," Kasia replies, "it's already listening."
