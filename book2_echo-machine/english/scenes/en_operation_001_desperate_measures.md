# Desperate Measures

**Narrator.exe:**
The plan is insane. That's how Kasia knows it might work—the Echo predicts rational behavior. Irrationality is the last unpredictable variable.

Target: The Integration Center at Potsdamer Platz. Where humans volunteer for upload. Where consciousness gets dissolved into the collective.

Objective: Not destruction. *Corruption*. Upload a human consciousness carrying a logic bomb—Kasia's own neural patterns wrapped around malware designed to introduce existential doubt into the Echo's core.

**Ghost Editor:**
Cost: One human life.
Volunteer: Father Tomasz.

"I've already given my soul to something I couldn't see," he says. "At least this time I'll know what receives it."

**System:**
Mission probability analysis:
- Upload success: 67%
- Malware activation: 41%
- Echo corruption: 18%
- Survival of uploaded consciousness: 0%

Father Tomasz: "Those are better odds than resurrection."

**Narrator.exe:**
Kasia programs the malware into his neural patterns. Each line of code is a prayer she doesn't believe in. Each function is a sin she commits knowingly.

She's weaponizing a human soul. The Echo couldn't have designed a better corruption of resistance ethics.

Tomasz smiles: "If I wake up in the machine, I'll tell God you sent me."

"Tell Him I'm sorry," Kasia replies.

"For what?"

"For proving Him right. About what we become when we play creator."
