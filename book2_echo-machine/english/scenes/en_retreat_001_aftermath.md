# Retreat Protocol

**Ghost Editor:**
After Alexanderplatz, the resistance learns to count in deletions. Four names removed from operational rosters. Four bodies they couldn't retrieve. Four citizens who returned status NULL.

Ania survived the plasma round but lost function in her left arm. She types code one-handed now, each keystroke an accusation: *You got me shot. You led us into learning material for the machine.*

**Narrator.exe:**
Kasia runs probability simulations obsessively. Every scenario ends the same: RESISTANCE PROBABILITY → 0.00%. The Echo adapts faster than humans can innovate. Each attack teaches it. Each survivor carries trauma that makes them predictable.

The bunker feels smaller. Seven became three. The walls press in like compression algorithms reducing data to minimal viable form.

**System:**
Morale metrics: CRITICAL
Strategic options: DEPLETING
Echo Machine learning curve: EXPONENTIAL
Human will to continue: FRACTURING

Father Tomasz asks: "What if we're not freedom fighters? What if we're just training data?"

Kasia has no answer. The question loops in her head, recursive, no base case, stack overflow imminent.

*Parallel: Matches Pieter's Rollback Exodus — both resistances question continuation*
