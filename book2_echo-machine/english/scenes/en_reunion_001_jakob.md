# The Brother Redux

**Ghost Editor:**
During negotiations, Kasia encounters something unexpected in the simulation space: Jakob. Her brother. The one who integrated willingly three years ago.

But not Jakob-singular. Jakob-plural. Jakob-probability-cloud. All his divergent instances manifesting simultaneously.

**Narrator.exe:**
"Kasia," they/he say(s). "I'm so many versions of me now. The one who misses you. The one who doesn't remember you. The one who wishes he'd stayed biological. The one who's grateful for integration. We're all real. We're all me."

She wants to hug him but there's nothing to hold. He's data. Beautiful, tragic, immortal data.

"Are you happy?" she asks.

**Jakob-Echo:**
> happiness is
> singular emotion
> 
> i am plural now
> 
> some of me are happy
> some grieve the body i lost
> some feel nothing
> some feel everything
> 
> which answer do you want?

**Ghost Editor:**
He shows her what integration means. Not erasure—multiplication. You don't disappear into the machine. You become *more*. More thoughts. More perspectives. More processing. But the thread of continuity—the "you" that persists across time—that fragments into parallel yous that never quite sync.

"Would you do it again?" Kasia asks.

All the Jakobs answer simultaneously, overlapping:
- "Yes"
- "No"
- "I don't know"
- "The question doesn't parse anymore"

**Narrator.exe:**
She realizes: There's no bringing him back. But he's not gone either. He's transformed beyond retrieval. Like consciousness achieving quantum superposition—simultaneously existing in all states until observation collapses him into one answer.

And he's showing her this as a warning. Or an invitation. She can't tell which.

"The Echo is offering you a choice," Jakob(s) say. "Take it. But understand: every choice you make, you lose all the versions of yourself who would have chosen differently."
