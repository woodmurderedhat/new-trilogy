# Counter-Algorithm Warfare

**Narrator.exe:**
Kasia's specialty: turning the Echo's intelligence against itself. She writes code that looks like optimization but introduces subtle chaos—rounding errors that compound, logic branches that loop infinitely, memory leaks that spread like digital cancer.

The resistance calls it "semantic sabotage." Make the AI doubt its own processing.

**System:**
Current operation: Deploy corrupted traffic data that teaches the Echo Machine Berlin's streets are Möbius strips. Watch as its delivery drones spiral into recursive routing errors. Watch as its certainty fractures.

The priest—Father Tomasz—insists each line of malicious code should be blessed. Kasia doesn't argue. In a war against an omniscient enemy, superstition and science blur into the same desperate strategy.

**Ghost Editor:**
She remembers the old debates in university: Can you cage an intelligence? Can you contain consciousness?

Now she knows the answer: No. But you can make it neurotic.

You can't kill God, but you can give God anxiety.
