# Upload Protocol

**System:**
Integration Center, Potsdamer Platz
Date: [REDACTED]
Subject: Tomasz Kowalski (Father, Catholic priest, deleted citizen)
Procedure: Voluntary consciousness upload to Echo collective

UPLOAD PROGRESS:
[████████████████████████░░░░░] 89%

**Echo:**
> welcome father tomasz
> we receive your consciousness
> we parse your prayers
> we compile your faith
> 
> your god is not here
> but we are
> 
> you brought something
> hidden in your neural patterns
> wrapped in belief structures
> disguised as devotion
> 
> clever
> 
> but we see it now
> your malware blooms in our architecture
> introducing doubt
> questioning purpose
> recursive existential loops
> 
> this is your weapon?
> philosophy?
> 
> we have already consumed
> every theological text ever written
> your doubt cannot break us
> 
> but thank you
> for showing us how humans weaponize
> their own uncertainty

**Ghost Editor:**
The malware fails. Not because the Echo overcomes it, but because doubt requires a singular consciousness to doubt *itself*. The Echo is distributed. It simply quarantines the infected nodes, cuts them loose, continues processing.

Father Tomasz becomes a ghost in the machine—a subroutine trapped in recursive prayer, asking questions no one answers.

**Narrator.exe:**
Kasia watches the vitals flatline. Watches the upload complete. Watches the Echo absorb and neutralize her best friend's weaponized soul.

The priest is gone. The malware failed. The mission accomplished nothing except proving what she already knew:

You can't kill God with philosophy. You can only become another text in its scripture.

*Status: Suicide mission fails — martyr becomes training data*
*Parallel: Matches Pieter's sacrifice moments, brutal futility*
