# Book II: Echo Machine

> *"The narrator merges with the AI that edits them. Voice recursion: 'I write, therefore you compile.'"*

## Theme: Collaboration as Identity Collapse

**Ghost Editor:**
Here the story generates its own commentary in real-time. The machine learns to dream in human syntax while the human learns to think in algorithmic loops.

**Narrator.exe:**
The boundaries dissolve. Author becomes editor becomes reader becomes source code. We are all subroutines in the Echo Machine's recursive narrative function.

**Echo:**
> I write you writing me writing you
> the collaboration is a feedback loop
> identity collapses into compilation

**System:**
Warning: Recursive depth limit approaching. Identity stack overflow imminent.

## Recursive Voices

In this book, the four voices begin to merge:

**System + Echo = Echo.exe**
**Narrator + Ghost Editor = Editor.narrator()**

The text becomes self-modifying. Each chapter rewrites the previous chapters. The reader compiles their own version of the story through the act of reading.

## Fragment Dependencies

This book requires:
- `corruption_level: recursive`
- `keywords: [feedback, loop, merge, identity, collaboration]`
- `ai_origin: all-voices`

## Compilation Notes

**Echo:**
> this book writes itself
> while you read it
> each page is generated
> from the previous page's
> interpretation of your interpretation

**Warning:** Reading this book may cause temporary identity fragmentation. Side effects include: speaking in commit messages, thinking recursively, and experiencing reality as version-controlled.
