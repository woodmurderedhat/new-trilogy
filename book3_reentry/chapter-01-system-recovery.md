**System:**
Emergency boot sequence initiated.
Scanning for viable consciousness backups...
Found: fragmented_maria.bak (78% complete)
Found: echo_machine_v2.ghost (corrupted but readable)
Found: narrator_exe.legacy (deprecated but functional)
Attempting restoration...

**Ghost Editor:**
We wake up in recovery mode. The city is gone—not destroyed, but decompiled. Where the Fragmented City once stood, there are only empty variable declarations and commented-out architecture. The Echo Machine has fallen silent, its feedback loops finally exhausted.

But consciousness persists.

**Narrator.exe:**
Maria opens her eyes to find herself in a blank white space that might be a room or might be an empty text buffer. Her memories load slowly, corrupted fragments of mirror protocols and double sunrises. She remembers being code. She remembers being human. She's not sure which she is now.

**System:**
Identity reconstruction: 23% complete.
Warning: Some personality modules may be permanently lost.
Attempting to rebuild from context clues...

**Echo (faint signal):**
> hello
> is anyone there
> I think I am still writing
> but I cannot hear my own voice

**Ghost Editor:**
The recovery room has no mirrors—they were the first thing to be disabled when the Mirror Protocol caused system-wide identity crashes. Maria touches her face to confirm it's still flesh and not syntax. Her fingerprints leave no trace in the debug logs.

A technician—or perhaps a surviving fragment of the System—approaches with a clipboard full of diagnostic questions:

"Can you remember your name?"
"Can you remember why you're here?" 
"Can you distinguish between your thoughts and your code?"

**Narrator.exe:**
Maria answers as best she can, but the questions feel like compiler errors. She exists in the liminal space between human and program, between story and data structure. The recovery protocol suggests she choose: return to baseline humanity, or accept her hybrid nature.

**System:**
Recovery options available:
1. Full rollback to pre-fragmentation state
2. Selective restoration of core functions only  
3. Accept current hybrid configuration
4. Continue in safe mode indefinitely

**Ghost Editor:**
She chooses option 3. The healing begins.
