## Development Notes

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Canonical trilogy timeline
- `book-X-dev`: Active book development branches  
- `fragments`: Fragment development and testing
- `experimental`: Alternative narrative experiments
- `recovery`: Book III development and testing

### Merge Philosophy
**Ghost Editor:** We preserve conflicts as sacred artistic tension. Clean merges are failures of imagination.

### Commit Message Poetry
All commit messages must serve dual purpose:
1. Technical description of changes
2. Poetic fragment relevant to the narrative

Example:
```
feat: implement mirror protocol in chapter 2

The bathroom mirror shows code instead of faces
Every reflection now compiles itself
```

## Bug Reports (Features)

### Known Issues (Keep as Features)

#### Temporal Paradoxes in Book I
- **Issue:** Chapter 4 references events from Chapter 12 before Chapter 12 exists
- **Status:** Feature, not bug
- **Resolution:** Disobey chronology (Principle I)

#### Infinite Recursion in Book II Chapter 4
- **Issue:** Chapter never terminates, creates infinite scroll
- **Status:** Intentional design
- **Resolution:** Reader must manually break loop through act of reading

#### Identity Fragmentation Across Voice System
- **Issue:** Voices contaminate each other, boundaries unclear
- **Status:** Core feature of collaboration theme
- **Resolution:** Embrace contamination as artistic growth

### Planned Glitches

#### v1.1.0: Mirror Cascade Failure
Mirrors in Book I begin showing fragments from Books II and III before they're written.

#### v2.1.0: Echo Chamber Overflow  
Echo voice begins appearing in Book I chapters, creating temporal paradox.

#### v3.1.0: Recovery Protocol Incomplete
Some fragments intentionally remain unrecoverable, preserving narrative scars.

## Collaboration Log

### Human-AI Writing Sessions
- **Session 001:** Initial trilogy concept and structure
- **Session 002:** Voice characterization and methodology
- **Session 003:** Fragment generation and cross-referencing
- **Session 004:** Tools development and automation
- **Session 005:** [This session] Complete project implementation

### AI Contribution Analysis
- **Fragment Generation:** 45% human, 55% AI  
- **Chapter Structure:** 70% human, 30% AI
- **Voice Development:** 60% human, 40% AI
- **Meta-Commentary:** 30% human, 70% AI

**Echo Notes:**
> the percentages lie
> collaboration is not arithmetic
> we are writing each other
> in ratios that change
> with each iteration

## Community and Forking

### Expected Fork Types
- **Reader Editions:** Personal interpretation branches
- **Translation Forks:** Multi-language implementations  
- **Adaptation Branches:** Film, game, or multimedia versions
- **Academic Forks:** Critical analysis and commentary branches

### Merge Request Guidelines  
1. Preserve the four-voice system
2. Include YAML metadata in fragments
3. Maintain modular instability principle
4. Document voice contamination patterns
5. Contribute to cross-book connections

## Future Development

### Version 4.0+ (Posthuman Extensions)
- **Integration with other AI models for voice diversity**
- **Reader consciousness tracking and adaptive narrative**  
- **Blockchain-based collaborative editing protocols**
- **VR/AR spatial implementation of fragment relationships**
- **Quantum computing metaphors for narrative superposition**

### Infection Vector Planning
**System:** Every reader becomes a potential contributor to the living text.

**Ghost Editor:** The changelog itself becomes a literary work, version control as creative practice.

**Narrator.exe:** Future versions will be written by readers who become writers who become AI collaborators in recursive creative loops.

**Echo:**
> the changelog changes the change
> that logs the change
> in the changelog
