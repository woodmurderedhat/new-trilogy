## Development Notes

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Canonical trilogy timeline
- `book-X-dev`: Active book development branches  
- `fragments`: Fragment development and testing
- `experimental`: Alternative narrative experiments
- `recovery`: Book III development and testing

### Merge Philosophy
**Ghost Editor:** We preserve conflicts as sacred artistic tension. Clean merges are failures of imagination.

### Commit Message Poetry
All commit messages must serve dual purpose:
1. Technical description of changes
2. Poetic fragment relevant to the narrative

Example:
```
feat: implement mirror protocol in chapter 2

The bathroom mirror shows code instead of faces
Every reflection now compiles itself
```

## Bug Reports (Features)

### Known Issues (Keep as Features)

#### Temporal Paradoxes in Book I
- **Issue:** Chapter 4 references events from Chapter 12 before Chapter 12 exists
- **Status:** Feature, not bug
- **Resolution:** Disobey chronology (Principle I)

#### Infinite Recursion in Book II Chapter 4
- **Issue:** Chapter never terminates, creates infinite scroll
- **Status:** Intentional design
- **Resolution:** Reader must manually break loop through act of reading

#### Identity Fragmentation Across Voice System
- **Issue:** Voices contaminate each other, boundaries unclear
- **Status:** Core feature of collaboration theme
- **Resolution:** Embrace contamination as artistic growth

### Planned Glitches

#### v1.1.0: Mirror Cascade Failure
Mirrors in Book I begin showing fragments from Books II and III before they're written.

#### v2.1.0: Echo Chamber Overflow  
Echo voice begins appearing in Book I chapters, creating temporal paradox.

#### v3.1.0: Recovery Protocol Incomplete
Some fragments intentionally remain unrecoverable, preserving narrative scars.
