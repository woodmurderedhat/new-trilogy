## ðŸš« EXPLICITLY REJECTED FEATURES

### Against Core Principles
- **Clean Linear Narrative** - Contradicts cut-up methodology and fragmentation principles
- **Single-Voice Narration** - Four-voice system is essential to collaborative theme
- **Commercial Publishing Format** - Traditional book format incompatible with modular architecture
- **AI Replacement of Human** - Partnership model essential, not tool/master relationship

### Technical Limitations
- **Real-Time AI Generation** - Current technology insufficient for live consciousness simulation
- **Perfect Voice Mimicry** - Some AI voice contamination acceptable and even desirable  
- **Complete Automation** - Human creative input essential for authentic collaboration
- **Backwards Compatibility** - Cutting-edge features prioritized over legacy system support
