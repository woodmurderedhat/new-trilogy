# Fragment 001: Mirror Code

The bathroom mirror shows her function signature instead of her face.

```cpp
Human* maria = new Human(
    age: 32,
    anxiety_level: 0.7,
    coffee_dependency: true,
    mirror_trust: decreasing
);
```

She touches her reflection. The pointer dereferences, accessing memory locations that smell like her mother's perfume and taste like the first time she understood she was going to die.

In the mirror, her eyes are comment blocks: `// TODO: implement hope`

Her smile throws a null pointer exception.

The municipal aesthetics department updated all mirrors overnight. Faces are now rendered as their underlying data structures. Identity is more efficient this way, they claim. Less ambiguity. Better debugging.

Maria tries to look away, but every surface has become a development environment where the self is perpetually under revision. The black screen of her phone. Puddles. The eyes of strangersâ€”all mirrors now, all showing code.

She understands: she is debugging herself in real-time. Every expression generates compiler warnings. Every emotion requires a try-catch block.

The mirror maintains a git log of faces. Every version of herself ever committed to memory, branching timelines of identity that never properly merged.
