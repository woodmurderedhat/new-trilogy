# Fragment 002: Subway Protocols

The underground transit system runs on deprecated emotional algorithms.

Each train car contains exactly 47 seats and 73 standing positions, optimized for maximum psychological discomfort. The fluorescent lights flicker at 23.7 Hz—just below the threshold of conscious awareness but precisely calibrated to induce mild temporal dissociation.

Maria descends into the station. The turnstiles scan her neural patterns alongside her metro card, cross-referencing her current anxiety level with demographic data harvested from a thousand other Tuesday mornings.

**System:**
Platform sensors detect 147 individual heartbeats, each synchronized to the municipal pulse. The approaching train broadcasts its arrival through bone conduction speakers embedded in the platform floor.

**Ghost Editor:**
She doesn't notice the advertisements have been personalized. Each poster shows her face wearing different products, living different lives. Marketing algorithms have learned to dream her future.

The train arrives. Doors open with the sound of compressed sighs. Inside, passengers stare at screens that stare back. The mutual surveillance creates a feedback loop—watching watching watching until the boundaries dissolve.

**Echo:**
> underground overground  
> transit transitions transitioning  
> the train carries its cargo of consciousness  
> through tunnels that remember every passenger  
> who ever descended into darkness  

The subway map updates itself in real-time, routes shifting based on collective emotional states. Today, the purple line extends into neighborhoods that don't exist yet.

Maria finds a seat between two strangers. Their proximity creates an accidental network—three human nodes temporarily linked by electromagnetic field overlap and the shared experience of voluntary burial beneath the city.

The train begins to move, carrying its cargo of temporary identities through the city's circulatory system.
