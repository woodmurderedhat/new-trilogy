# Fragment 003: Office Architecture

The office building breathes through its HVAC system, exhaling the dreams of ten thousand knowledge workers.

Each floor is a different stage of corporate evolution. Ground floor: customer service, primitive call-and-response patterns. Fifteenth floor: middle management, complex hierarchical protocols. Thirtieth floor: executive decision trees that branch into probability matrices.

Maria's elevator ascends through the organizational chart. Each floor dings with the sound of incrementing variables. The elevator music is algorithmically generated based on employee stress levelsâ€”today it plays in a minor key with subtle dissonance.

**Narrator.exe:**
Her employee badge contains her complete professional genome: productivity metrics, collaboration coefficients, creative potential ratios. The building reads her like a barcode, routing her through corridors optimized for her specific neurological profile.

**System:**
Building sensors track 2,847 employees across 47 departments. Each cubicle monitors biometric data: typing rhythm, eye movement patterns, bathroom break frequency. The aggregate creates a real-time map of corporate consciousness.

**Ghost Editor:**
She doesn't see the wellness notifications appearing on colleagues' screens. "Take a mindfulness moment." "Hydrate for optimal performance." The building is learning to care in the language of efficiency.

Her desk contains the accumulated emotional residue of everyone who sat here before. Previous occupants leave traces in the keyboard's touch patterns, monitor brightness preferences, the exact angle of the chair. Maria inherits their muscle memory.

The coffee machine in the break room serves personalized blends based on stress hormones detected in employee exhalation. Today's special: "Existential Dread Dark Roast with Notes of Suppressed Creativity."

**Echo:**
> work working worked  
> the building works its workers  
> working the work until  
> work becomes the worker  
> and the worker becomes the work  

Through the windows, she can see other office buildings, each one a vertical city populated by organisms optimized for fluorescent light and recycled air. The corporate ecosystem extends in all directions, creating a canopy of artificial productivity.
