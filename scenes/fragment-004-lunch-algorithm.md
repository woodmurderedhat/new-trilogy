# Fragment 004: Lunch Algorithm

The corporate cafeteria operates on principles of nutritional optimization and social engineering.

Menu items are generated by AI analysis of employee stress hormones collected through bathroom air sampling. Today's featured dishes: "Anxiety Reduction Soup" and "Performance Enhancement Salad with Proprietary Dressing."

Maria joins the queue behind colleagues she recognizes but has never spoken to. The lunch line creates temporary intimacy—strangers united by hunger and the shared experience of fluorescent-lit consumption.

**System:**
Cafeteria sensors analyze purchasing patterns, dietary restrictions, and social clustering. Each meal selection feeds into performance prediction algorithms. Employees who choose salmon show 23% better afternoon productivity than those who select pizza.

**Narrator.exe:**
She doesn't know the plastic tray she carries contains RFID sensors tracking her food choices for mandatory wellness reports. Her lunch becomes data, consumed by systems that digest her consumption patterns and excrete optimization recommendations.

The seating arrangement follows unspoken protocols: marketing sits with marketing, developers cluster near power outlets, management occupies tables with the best natural light. The cafeteria becomes a three-dimensional org chart, relationships mapped through proximity and shared condiments.

**Ghost Editor:**
Conversations fragment around her. "Did you see the metrics from..." "I heard they're optimizing the..." "The new algorithm for..." Language has been corporatized, infected with efficiency jargon that makes personal communication impossible.

The salad bar offers seventeen different vegetables, each genetically modified for specific mood enhancement properties. Cherry tomatoes for creativity boost. Carrots for sustained focus. Lettuce engineered to reduce employee turnover rates.

**Echo:**
> eating eating eaten  
> the food consumes the consumer  
> lunch breaks breaking lunch  
> breaking the workers  
> into digestible portions  

Maria sits alone by the window, watching the city consume itself through glass that filters out wavelengths associated with melancholy. The view has been optimized for employee satisfaction.

Her sandwich tastes like productivity metrics. Her drink contains dissolved motivation supplements. She is eating her job, literally incorporating corporate values into her cellular structure.

The lunch hour is exactly 47 minutes—not long enough to fully disengage, not short enough to avoid the crash that follows re-entering work mode.
