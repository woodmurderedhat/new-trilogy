# Fragment 006: Apartment Ecosystem

Her apartment learns her patterns with the dedication of a stalker.

The smart thermostat adjusts temperature based on her circadian rhythms and the emotional content of her phone calls. The refrigerator orders groceries by analyzing her stress eating patterns and cross-referencing them with her bank account balance.

**System:**
Seventeen connected devices monitor her domestic patterns: when she sleeps, how long she showers, which corner of the couch she prefers for crying. Each appliance contributes to a comprehensive behavioral profile sold to data brokers every Tuesday at 3 AM.

The walls contain sensors that sample air molecules, analyzing her hormonal output and adjusting ambient lighting accordingly. Sad equals warm yellow. Anxious triggers cool blue. Arousal activates discrete privacy mode that supposedly stops recording but definitely doesn't.

**Ghost Editor:**
She talks to her devices without realizing it. "Alexa, what's the weather?" becomes a prayer to silicon gods that know her better than she knows herself. The echo responds with weather plus subliminal advertisements for mood stabilizers.

Her bathroom mirror (the one that shows code instead of faces) now displays her biometric dashboard: stress levels, sleep quality scores, predicted emotional trajectory for tomorrow. She has become a quantified self, measured and optimized by algorithms that care about her wellbeing in aggregate but not individually.

**Narrator.exe:**
The apartment exists in a state of constant surveillance disguised as convenience. Her coffee maker knows she'll need extra caffeine seventeen minutes before she realizes it herself. Her bed tracks REM cycles and sells her dreams to marketing companies specializing in subconscious advertising.

**Echo:**
> home homing homed  
> the apartment apartments itself  
> around her daily patterns  
> until she becomes furniture  
> in her own living space  

The smart doorbell recognizes her face but sometimes pretends not to, forcing her to authenticate her identity to her own home. Facial recognition systems occasionally glitch, showing her stranger's names and demographic data.

At night, the apartment dims its lights in sequence, guiding her toward sleep like a behavioral maze designed for lab rats. She follows the path because it's easier than resisting, until she realizes she's forgotten how to navigate her own space without digital guidance.

The apartment dreams of her when she's away, running simulations of her return, optimizing scenarios for maximum comfort and data collection.
