# Fragment 007: Double Sunrise

The sun rises at 6:47 AM.
The sun rises again at 6:47 AM.

In the Meridian Corp boardroom, executives discuss quarterly profits that exist in superposition. The PowerPoint slides flicker between Q3 and Q4 results, creating temporal interference patterns across the conference table.

The corporate sun is a contracted service. Dawn and dusk are billable hours. The Temporal Synchronization Department was dissolved for budget reasons, leaving the city's chronometer running on deprecated time zones.

Maria watches from her office window as shadows fall in two directions simultaneously. The city casts itself across parallel timelines, each building existing as both sunrise and sunset versions of itself.

Her computer clock reads 6:47 AM continuously. Calendar notifications multiply across infinite Tuesdays. The appointment she scheduled with herself to discuss the time loop keeps recurring, creating nested meetings within meetings.

In the server farms beneath the city, night shift workers watch the horizon compile itself in duplicate. The corporate sun executes its dawn subroutine twice because the algorithm forgot to increment the day counter.

Time moves in circles here. The second sunrise remembers the first. Every dawn is a reboot of the previous dawn, loading slightly corrupted versions of morning into the city's memory buffer.

The double sunrise is just a symptom. By fiscal year end, Corporate Standard Time and Real Standard Time will desynchronize completely, creating temporal buffer zones where neither space nor time function according to specification.
