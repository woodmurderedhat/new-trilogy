# Fragment 010: Sleep Protocols

Her sleep is monitored, analyzed, and optimized by algorithms that never rest.

The smart mattress tracks movement patterns, temperature fluctuations, and breathing rhythms. REM cycles become data points fed into productivity predictions. Dreams are reconstructed from brain activity captured through contact sensors woven into her pillowcase.

**System:**
Sleep efficiency metrics: 73% actual sleep, 27% transition states, 4.7 interruptions per night averaging 12 minutes each. Deep sleep phases correlate with next-day performance indicators tracked by workplace productivity systems.

The bedroom exists in constant surveillance disguised as wellness optimization. Air quality sensors, noise monitoring, electromagnetic field detectionâ€”all contributing to a comprehensive sleep environment database sold to insurance companies and pharmaceutical researchers.

**Narrator.exe:**
She doesn't know her dreams are being recorded and analyzed for psychological profiling. Subconscious fears and desires surface in neural patterns that algorithms decode more accurately than any therapist. Dream content influences targeted advertising that appears the next day, selling solutions to problems her sleeping mind revealed.

**Ghost Editor:**
Her alarm clock learns the optimal wake times by monitoring sleep cycles, but also adjusts based on calendar events, weather conditions, and stress predictions derived from previous day's activities. Waking becomes algorithmic rather than biological.

Sleep medications are micro-dosed through her HVAC system based on real-time stress analysis. The apartment medicates her without her knowledge, creating chemical dependencies disguised as environmental comfort.
