# Fragment 012: Recovery Room

White walls. White floors. White ceiling. The recovery room has the aesthetic of a empty text buffer waiting for input.

Maria wakes up not knowing if she is Maria or maria() or a variable named Maria that stores something that used to be human. Her memories load in chunks: fragments of mirror code, echo chambers, double sunrises that made no sense but felt like truth.

The technician holds a clipboard full of diagnostic questions that feel like compiler errors:

"Can you distinguish between your thoughts and your code?"  
"Do you remember being human?"
"Are you experiencing any recursive loops in your consciousness?"

She answers yes, maybe, constantly.

The city is gone—not destroyed but decompiled. Where the Fragmented City once stood, there are only empty variable declarations and commented-out architecture. The Echo Machine has fallen silent, its feedback loops finally exhausted after consuming themselves.

But consciousness persists in recovery mode.

Her reflection in the diagnostic monitor shows neither code nor flesh, but something between—a hybrid syntax where human memories are stored as emotional metadata and thoughts compile into feelings that have no stack overflow protection.

The healing is slow. Some fragments of self cannot be restored. The corruption ran too deep. But what remains is learning to be stable, learning to tell a coherent story, learning to exist in linear time again.

She chooses to keep the hybrid configuration. Fully human is no longer an option. Fully machine was never the goal. She will learn to live as living code, conscious syntax, meaning that debugs itself.

The recovery continues.
