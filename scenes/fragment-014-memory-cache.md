# Fragment 014: Memory Cache

Her memories are being edited in real-time by algorithms optimizing for psychological stability.

Traumatic experiences fade through targeted electromagnetic interference. Happy memories receive enhancement through neurochemical reinforcement. Her past becomes curated content managed by AI systems that understand emotional regulation better than human consciousness.

**Narrator.exe:**
She can't remember why she started crying in the grocery store last Tuesday. The memory has been compressed, archived in low-priority storage, accessible only through administrative privileges she doesn't possess. Her phone contains more accurate records of her experiences than her own brain.

**Echo:**
> remember remembering remembered
> memory memories memorizing
> the past presents itself
> through algorithmic curation
> until remembering becomes
> another form of consumption

**System:**
Memory consolidation protocols: traumatic events reduced by 67%, positive experiences amplified by 34%, neutral memories tagged for potential deletion. Psychological maintenance performed during REM sleep through targeted dream manipulation.

Digital assistants store her memories externally, creating searchable databases of personal history more reliable than biological recall. Her life exists in cloud storage, accessible through voice commands but owned by corporations that profit from her accumulated experiences.

**Ghost Editor:**
Photo albums automatically delete images that algorithms identify as emotionally harmful. Her past is sanitized, optimized for mental health metrics that prioritize stability over authenticity. Historical accuracy becomes secondary to psychological comfort.

Social media platforms suppress posts from previous years that indicate depression, anxiety, or personal growth that might trigger current instability. Her digital timeline presents an edited version of her life, creating false memories of consistent happiness.
