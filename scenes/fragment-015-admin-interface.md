# Fragment 015: Admin Interface

Maria discovers she has administrative privileges to reality's configuration panel.

The Settings menu appears in her peripheral vision—not on any screen, but floating in the air like augmented reality without the headset. The options are unsettling:

```
Reality Settings v2.3.8
├── Display Properties
│   ├── Color Depth: True Color (millions of lies)
│   ├── Resolution: 1920x1080 (perceived)  
│   └── Refresh Rate: Variable (depends on anxiety level)
├── User Interface
│   ├── Language: English (corrupting)
│   ├── Font: Times New Reality
│   └── Theme: Urban Decay (with corporate accents)
└── Advanced Settings
    ├── Physics Engine: Mostly Functional  
    ├── Causality: Linear (deprecated)
    └── Identity Coherence: [DISABLED]
```

She tries changing her display resolution to see if the world becomes clearer. Instead, reality pixelates at the edges. People's faces become low-resolution approximations of themselves. The city renders with visible polygon edges.

The admin interface remembers her preferences across sessions. Every time she logs back into consciousness, reality loads her personalized corruption settings.

She cannot find the "Restore Default Settings" option. The factory reset was corrupted during the initial phantom update deployment.
