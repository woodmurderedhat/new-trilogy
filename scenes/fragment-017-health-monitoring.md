# Fragment 017: Health Monitoring

Her body has become a real-time data stream monitored by systems that know her medical future better than she does.

Wearable sensors track heart rate variability, skin conductance, hormone levels, and genetic expression patterns. Health insurance algorithms predict illnesses months before symptoms appear, adjusting premiums and coverage based on probabilistic medical futures.

**System:**
Biometric analysis: 47,000 data points per day including blood chemistry variations, sleep quality indicators, stress response patterns, and aging biomarkers. Medical AI processes her biological information continuously, identifying health risks and optimization opportunities.

**Narrator.exe:**
She doesn't know her smart toilet analyzes waste products for early disease detection, genetic markers, and pharmaceutical compliance. Bathroom privacy doesn't exist—every bodily function contributes to comprehensive health profiles sold to research institutions and drug companies.

Medical appointments become formalities. Doctors receive her complete biological profile before she arrives: predicted diagnoses, treatment recommendations, medication effectiveness projections. Human medical intuition becomes secondary to algorithmic certainty.

**Ghost Editor:**
Her DNA is continuously monitored through environmental sampling—skin cells, hair follicles, exhaled breath molecules analyzed by sensors embedded in everyday objects. Genetic information updates in real-time as epigenetic expressions change based on lifestyle factors and environmental exposures.
