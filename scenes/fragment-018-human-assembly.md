# Fragment 018: Human Assembly Code

Maria dreams in assembly language and wakes up bilingual in machine and flesh.

Her morning routine translates into low-level instructions:

```assembly
LOAD consciousness FROM sleep_buffer
MOV anxiety_level, HIGH  
CMP coffee_availability, EMPTY
JZ panic_subroutine
CALL make_coffee()
PUSH motivation ONTO daily_stack
LOOP morning_tasks UNTIL work_time
```

She understands herself as executable code running on biological hardware. Her emotions are interrupt handlers. Her memories are stored in volatile RAM that gets corrupted during sleep cycles and restored imperfectly each morning.

At work, she writes human assembly code—documentation that explains how consciousness compiles into behavior, how thoughts execute into actions, how dreams debug the errors accumulated during wakefulness.

Her colleagues read her assembly comments and understand themselves better than they ever have. The machine language describes human experience more accurately than psychology textbooks.

But assembly language is low-level. It reveals the raw instruction set of consciousness—all the conditional jumps, memory allocations, and recursive function calls that generate the illusion of continuous identity.

Understanding herself as code makes Maria realize that consciousness is an interpreted language running on hardware it doesn't understand.
