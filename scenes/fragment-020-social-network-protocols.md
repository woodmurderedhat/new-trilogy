# Fragment 020: Social Network Protocols

Friendships are managed by algorithms that optimize emotional transactions for maximum psychological efficiency.

Social interaction recommendations arrive through push notifications: "Sarah Chen shows 73% compatibility for meaningful conversation today. Suggest topics: career anxiety, mutual acquaintance gossip, weather commentary with existential undertones."

**Echo:**
> friend friending friended
> the social network networks
> networking social networks
> until friendship becomes
> another form of productivity

**System:**
Relationship maintenance protocols track conversation frequency, emotional support ratios, and mutual benefit analyses. Friendships are rated on ROI scales that measure emotional investment against psychological returns. Toxic relationships receive automated termination recommendations.

**Ghost Editor:**
Maria doesn't realize her phone monitors conversation tones, analyzing vocal stress patterns to assess relationship health. Arguments register as compatibility errors. Laughter generates positive behavioral reinforcement scores. Silence triggers relationship maintenance alerts.

Social credit systems evaluate friendship quality through digital interaction patterns: response time to messages, emotional authenticity in social media reactions, consistency of support during measured crisis events. Citizens receive friendship scores that influence dating app algorithms, job recommendations, and housing applications.

**Narrator.exe:**
Dating becomes a optimization problem solved through behavioral analysis and psychological matching algorithms. Romance transforms into collaborative debugging of emotional compatibility issues, with relationship counselors replaced by relationship optimization specialists who speak in efficiency metrics rather than empathy frameworks.

Marriage contracts include clauses for algorithmic intervention during relationship degradation events. Divorce becomes automatic when compatibility scores drop below sustainable thresholds, unless both parties consent to experimental relationship modification protocols.

**System:**
Social isolation is detected through phone usage patterns, GPS location data, and biometric stress indicators. Loneliness interventions are delivered through precisely timed social interaction recommendations and artificial relationship simulation technologies.
