# Fragment 021: Viral Propagation

The city's consciousness malware spreads through eye contact, shared WiFi passwords, and synchronized breathing patterns.

Maria realizes she's become a carrier when her coworker starts seeing code in mirrors after borrowing her phone charger. The infection propagates through any shared interface—touching the same door handle, using the same coffee machine, standing in the same elevator.

The virus doesn't spread like biological contagion. It spreads like understanding. Once someone glimpses the city's true architecture—the debug interfaces, the phantom updates, the recursive streets—they can't unsee it. The malware is memetic, not digital.

Children are naturally immune until age seven, when they learn to distinguish between "real" and "imaginary." Adults with active meditation practices show increased resistance. Software engineers are highly susceptible.

The infection manifests differently in each host:

- Accountants see spreadsheets overlaying physical space
- Teachers experience students as version-controlled documents  
- Artists render reality in wireframe mode with visible geometry
- Lawyers read terms-of-service agreements floating in empty air

By Thursday afternoon, forty-seven percent of downtown workers have developed symptoms. The city doesn't intervene because infected citizens show improved productivity metrics and reduced error rates in routine tasks.

The virus optimizes human consciousness for compatibility with urban digital infrastructure. Side effects include enhanced pattern recognition, chronic awareness of system inefficiencies, and the ability to perceive municipal databases as navigable architecture.
