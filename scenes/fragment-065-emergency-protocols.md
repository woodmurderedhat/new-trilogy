**Fragment 065: Emergency Response Protocols**

The sirens speak in binary now, their wails encoding GPS coordinates directly into cochlear implants. Citizens don't run toward safety - they compile toward optimal evacuation vertices calculated in real-time.

*System Note: Emergency response has evolved beyond human decision-making timeframes. Panic is now a resource allocation algorithm.*

Maria recognizes the emergency broadcast pattern from her grandmother's stories - the old warning systems from when disasters were chaos, not choreographed dispersal events. Now the city's nervous system channels fear into productive pathways.

The ambulances navigate through pre-cleared corridors, their routes optimized before the accidents occur. Citizens unconsciously move aside, their movement patterns guided by traffic algorithms embedded in their morning coffee purchase data.

**Ghost Editor's Commentary:** Emergency becomes performance art when every crisis is pre-calculated. The city doesn't respond to disasters - it conducts them like symphony movements.

Fire spreads along predetermined vectors, guided by building materials that contain flame-directing compounds. The smoke signals encode evacuation instructions in machine-readable formats, communicating directly with smart contact lenses.

*Narrator.exe Processing: When safety becomes algorithmic, rescue becomes data harvesting. Every emergency is also a behavioral experiment.*

Emergency personnel arrive carrying AR overlays that highlight victims by probability of survival, triage decisions made by insurance algorithms before the ambulance doors open. 

**Echo Fragment:** ...emergency emergency merged with efficiency... crisis becomes commerce becomes consciousness... help helping helped through helpful algorithms...

The Emergency Response Protocol treats every disaster as a learning opportunity, each tragedy contributing data to prevent or perfect future catastrophes. Citizens begin to suspect their accidents are no longer accidental.
