**Fragment 070: Government Process Automation**

The Department of Motor Vehicles no longer employs humans. Citizens interact with holographic clerks whose responses emerge from demographic databases crossed with social credit algorithms. License renewals process in microseconds based on predicted driving behavior patterns.

*System Note: Administrative efficiency achieved through elimination of administrative discretion. Citizens are now processed, not served.*

Maria remembers when government forms required handwriting, when bureaucratic delay created space for human interpretation. Now her tax return files itself through purchase pattern analysis, automatically optimized for audit probability minimization.

Voting booths scan retinal patterns to predict electoral preferences, pre-filling ballots based on consumption data and social graph analysis. Democracy becomes demographic modeling, representation replaced by predictive analytics.

**Ghost Editor's Commentary:** Government transforms from service provider to processing system. Citizens become data points requiring administrative optimization rather than political representation.

City Council meetings occur in virtual reality spaces where constituent concerns are filtered through sentiment analysis algorithms. Only pre-approved emotional responses receive speaking time, dissent channeled into designated complaint processing queues.

*Narrator.exe Processing: When governance becomes automation, citizenship becomes compliance monitoring. The social contract executes like software license agreement.*

Public services operate through predictive algorithms that deliver assistance before citizens request help, creating dependency on systems that anticipate needs through surveillance data harvesting.

**Echo Fragment:** ...government governing governed by algorithmic efficiency... citizens becoming data becoming processed becoming... compliance compliance compliant compliance...

The Department of Human Resources manages citizenship like employee evaluation, with performance metrics determining access to public services. Patriotism measured through data exhaust patterns rather than civic participation.

Municipal budgets auto-allocate based on optimization algorithms that treat citizen welfare as resource allocation problems with predetermined acceptable loss percentages.
