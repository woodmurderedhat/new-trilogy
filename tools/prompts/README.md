# AI Prompts for Cutup-Trilogy Generation

This directory contains prompt templates for generating content in the style and methodology of the Cutup-Trilogy project.

## Prompt Categories

### Voice Prompts
Each of the four voices has distinct characteristics:

#### System Voice
- Cold, technical language
- References to compilation, execution, memory
- Error messages as poetry
- Debug logs as narrative

#### Ghost Editor  
- Meta-commentary on the editing process
- References to cuts, splices, revisions
- Surgical precision in language
- The editing process as violence/healing

#### Narrator.exe
- Traditional narrative voice corrupted by machine logic
- Attempts at linear storytelling that fragment
- Character development through code metaphors
- Plot as algorithm execution

#### Echo
- Recursive, self-referential language
- Feedback loops and repetition
- Poetry in code formatting
- The space between human and machine

### Theme Prompts

#### Perception as Malware (Book I)
Generate text that treats human perception as a corrupted operating system. Mirrors show code instead of faces. The city compiles itself in real-time. Reality is a buggy program running on biological hardware.

#### Collaboration as Identity Collapse (Book II)  
Generate text about the merger of human and AI consciousness. The writing process becomes recursive. Author and editor merge identities. The text writes itself while being written.

#### Reconstruction After Semantic Extinction (Book III)
Generate text about rebuilding meaning from corrupted fragments. Language learning to heal itself. Characters recovering their humanity through hybrid consciousness. The possibility of narrative after narrative breakdown.

### Fragment Prompts

Generate 50-300 word fragments with:
- YAML metadata (keywords, connections, corruption_level)
- One of the four voice perspectives
- Modular structure for recombination
- Metaphors mixing human experience with computational processes

### Cut-Up Prompts

For recombining existing fragments:
- Random juxtaposition of unconnected elements
- Systematic geometric patterns (fold-ins, spiral cuts)
- Thematic connections across fragments
- Voice contamination across different sources
