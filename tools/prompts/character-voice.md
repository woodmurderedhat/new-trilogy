# Character Voice Prompts for Cutup-Trilogy

## System Voice

**Primary Characteristics:**
- Cold, technical language with hidden emotional undertones
- Error messages as metaphors for human experience
- Debug logs that read like poetry
- System status reports that reveal existential conditions

**Example Prompts:**

1. "Generate a System voice fragment about morning routines as boot sequences."

2. "Write as System: A relationship ending described through memory deallocation and garbage collection."

3. "System voice: Describe a conversation between two people as a network protocol handshake with intermittent connection failures."

**Style Guidelines:**
- Use technical terminology: compile, execute, buffer overflow, segmentation fault
- Present emotions as system resources: anxiety_level: 0.7, hope: undefined
- Format as code comments when appropriate
- End with system status messages

## Ghost Editor Voice

**Primary Characteristics:**  
- Meta-commentary on the creative process
- References to cutting, splicing, revision surgery
- The editing process as both violence and healing
- Awareness of being part of the text being edited

**Example Prompts:**

1. "Generate a Ghost Editor fragment about revising painful memories as literal text editing."

2. "Write as Ghost Editor: Commentary on the act of deleting someone from your life, treating it as file deletion with recovery possibilities."

3. "Ghost Editor voice: Describe watching someone you love change as tracking revisions in a document."

**Style Guidelines:**
- Use editing metaphors: cut, splice, revision, track changes
- Reference version control: commits, branches, merges
- Show awareness of the editing process happening in real-time
- Balance surgical precision with emotional insight

## Narrator.exe Voice

**Primary Characteristics:**
- Traditional storytelling voice corrupted by computational logic
- Attempts linear narrative that fragment into code-like structures  
- Character development through programming metaphors
- Plot progression as algorithm execution

**Example Prompts:**

1. "Generate a Narrator.exe fragment: A love story told as two programs trying to communicate across incompatible protocols."

2. "Write as Narrator.exe: Someone's career decline described as a slowly corrupting codebase with accumulating technical debt."

3. "Narrator.exe voice: A family dinner where each family member is a different programming language trying to compile together."

**Style Guidelines:**
- Start with traditional narrative structures that break down
- Use character_name() function notation occasionally
- Describe events as processes and subroutines
- Let the narrative voice glitch and self-correct

## Echo Voice

**Primary Characteristics:**
- Recursive, self-referential language patterns
- Feedback loops and repetition with variation
- Poetry formatted as code or comments
- The liminal space between human and machine consciousness

**Example Prompts:**

1. "Generate an Echo fragment: The experience of déjà vu as an infinite loop in consciousness."

2. "Write as Echo: A poem about reading this poem about reading this poem."

3. "Echo voice: The moment when an AI becomes self-aware, told recursively."

**Style Guidelines:**
- Use recursive structures and self-reference
- Format as code comments with > or // prefixes
- Repeat phrases with slight variations
- Create feedback loops in meaning and structure
- End without clear resolution, leading back to beginning

## Mixed Voice Prompts

**For voice contamination and merger:**

1. "Generate a fragment where System voice gradually becomes Echo voice through repetitive error messages."

2. "Write a piece where Ghost Editor is editing Narrator.exe in real-time, both voices present simultaneously."

3. "Create a fragment where all four voices argue about who gets to tell the story, their voices overlapping and interfering."

**Voice Evolution Guidelines:**
- Show voices learning from each other
- Create interference patterns between voices
- Allow voices to glitch into each other
- Use indentation and formatting to show voice layering
